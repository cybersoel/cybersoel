<h2>Participated in..</h2>

- DEF CON 32 (2024)

<h2> My Projects:</h2>

- [Active Directory Home Lab](https://github.com/cybersoel/ActiveDirectoryLab)
  - Set up a virtualized Active Directory domain controller using Oracle VM VirtualBox, then leveraged PowerShell scripting to automate bulk user account creation and management in the directory service.
- [Azure Sentinel (SIEM) Lab](https://github.com/cybersoel/AzureSentinelSIEMLab)
  - Deployed a honeypot VM in Azure to attract RDP brute force attacks. Implemented a PowerShell script to monitor Windows Event Logs for failed login attempts and enrich the data using third-party geolocation APIs. Configured Azure Log Analytics to ingest the enhanced logs and utilized Azure Sentinel (SIEM) to analyze/map the inbound global RDP attacks.
- [Lab: Azure Entra & AD Connect](https://github.com/cybersoel/LabAzureEntraADConnect)
  - Deployed a traditional Active Directory environment with dual domain controllers on Azure VMs, then configured Azure AD Connect to synchronize user accounts and groups with Azure Active Directory for cloud-based identity management.
- [PfSense Firewall VM](https://github.com/cybersoel/PfSenseFirewallVM)
  - Deployed a pfSense virtual appliance as a network security gateway. Reconfigured the host's default gateway to route traffic through the pfSense VM, enhancing network segmentation. Explored and implemented various firewall parameters, including interface selection, protocol specifications, and source/destination controls. Experimented with targeted blocking rules and a carefully positioned allow-all rule to create a balance between security and accessibility
- [Lab: Nessus Essential Vulnerability Scanner](https://github.com/cybersoel/LabNessusEssentialVulnerabilityScanner)
  - Executed unauthenticated and authenticated vulnerability scans on a purposefully vulnerable VM using industry-standard tools. Analyzed results for critical vulnerabilities, attack surfaces, and CIA triad impacts. Implemented a strategic remediation plan addressing identified weaknesses through patch management and security hardening. Additionally, performed a vulnerability assessment on a legacy Windows XP VM to highlight end-of-life system risks.
- [MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform) deployment ](https://github.com/cybersoel/MISPMalwareInformationSharingPlatformdeployment)
  - Implemented a Malware Information Sharing Platform (MISP) in a test environment to enhance threat intelligence capabilities. Explored access control through user and organization management, customized threat visualization using dashboard widgets, and strengthened the defense posture by importing external threat feeds. Practiced incident response by creating and sharing cyber threat events, contributing to improved situational awareness and collaborative defense strategies.
- [Wireshark lab: Telnet sniffing](https://github.com/cybersoel/WiresharklabTelnetsniffing)
  - Conducted a network packet capture using Wireshark to demonstrate the vulnerability of Telnet protocol. Intercepted unencrypted credentials transmitted between Ubuntu and Windows 10 virtual machines, showcasing the risks of cleartext communication. Emphasized the importance of secure protocols like SSH for remote access to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks and credential theft.
- [Python: SHA1 Password Exploitation](https://github.com/cybersoel/PythonSHA1PasswordExploitation)
  - Developed a custom password cracking tool in Python targeting SHA1 hashed passwords. Implemented a dictionary attack method to exploit weak password practices. This project demonstrates the vulnerability of outdated hashing algorithms and highlights the importance of strong password policies and modern cryptographic techniques to enhance authentication security.
- [Recovering a JPG file from a RAM dump](https://github.com/cybersoel/RecoveringaJPGfilefromaRAMdump)
  - Conducted memory forensics on a RAM dump using manual file carving techniques. Employed a hex editor to locate and extract a JPG file by identifying its signature (header and footer). This demonstrates skills in volatile memory analysis, data recovery, and understanding of file structures crucial for digital investigations and incident response.
- [Volatility 3 : Memory Forensics](https://github.com/cybersoel/Volatility3MemoryForensics)
  - Conducted memory forensics with Volatility 3 using various plugins. Analyzed process execution, command-line arguments, network connections, user credentials, and registry keys from a memory dump. This demonstrates skills in digital forensics and post-exploitation artifact detection, which are crucial for understanding attacker behavior and system compromise indicators.
